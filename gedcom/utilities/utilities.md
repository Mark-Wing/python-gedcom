## Introduction

The utilities module contains sub-modules that use the GEDCOM Parser to complete useful tasks.  These tasks include:

* Splitter - Creates a GEDCOM including only specific person, their descendants, their descendant's spouses and the their descendant's spouses' parents.  Many software packages can export descendants and spouses, but do not include in-laws.

* Book - Creates a genealogy book for a specific person.  Currently in development.

* Scrubber - Creates a clean GEDCOM with primary facts, but no alternate facts or sources.  Currently in development.

* Statistics - Reads the GEDCOM and calculates statistics.  Currently in development.
